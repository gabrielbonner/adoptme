# To run locally:

- `git@github.com:gabrielbonner/adoptme.git`
- `cd adoptme`
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
- and then debug from there, since nothing ever runs correctly the first time ðŸ˜„
- visit `localhost:1234` in your browser of choice

# Notes:

- This is all from following the course here - https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v7
- Hoping to get this deployed to https://gabrielbonner.github.io/adoptme/ at some point
